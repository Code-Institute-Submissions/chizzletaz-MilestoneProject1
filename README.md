# **B-sharp - a professional Vocal Group**
### *Code Institute Milestone Project 1* 

This project is a frontend website for the fictitious vocal group “B-sharp”.  
The main focus for the website is to get people to buy tickets for their concerts and to book the group for events.  
 
The website provides information on upcoming concerts, on the group and its members and has some media samples. It also has the option buy tickets or to book the group for events.

- First time/occasional users looking for more information about the group


### **User stories:**	
**First time users:**

## **Scope level**

Combining the user needs and owner goals gives the following requirements:
Next to these I’ve indicated the importance vs viability/feasibility in a trade-off equation.

|					| importance  | viability/feasibility
| --- | :---: | :---: |
|a. provide information about the group | 4	| 5
|b. provide information about concerts	| 5	| 5
|c. option to buy tickets online | 5 |3
|d. option to book the group	| 5	| 4	
|e. providing media samples		| 4	| 3
|f. social media promotion		| 3	| 4	
|g. provide contact information		| 5	| 5
|h. provide newsletter subscription	|4		|3
|i. option to buy a song or album	|3		|1

*This means that the option to buy a song or album is not implemented now. This will be a feature left to implement.*

## **Structure level**

Using Interaction Design and Information Design I made the following decisions:  
I want to keep the website consistent by keeping the same page structure along all pages. This enhances the user’s single-use-learning:

- I kept the header and footer the same on each page (except for the home page)
- I styled the button elements the same way.

I want the website to be easy to navigate:
- A fixed responsive navigation bar at the top. 
- The logo at the top is also the link to the home page. 

I want the information easily visible:
- I use visual aids like icons, matching colours and images.
- not giving too much information at once. 

I want the user to get feedback during their visit:
- The user get’s a visual feedback during certain actions (e.g. focussing on, clicking on, hovering over buttons and links).

I’ve based the content requirements on the most likely path a first time user or event planner would take (navigation flow). That is: get to know more about the group (*About Us*) and their music (*Our Music*) and then get tickets for a show or book the group.
Therefore the order in which the websites (and links) are presented is: 
**Home - About us - Our Music - Our Shows - Contact (dropdown menu with Book us)**  
&nbsp;  

## **Skeleton level**
As mentioned above, the website will have 5 pages:  
Home, About us, Our Music, Our Shows and Contact.

**Home**  
has a hero image with a CTA-button to book the group. Below that there is a short overview of all the other webpages with links to the respective pages (where more information can be found).  
**About Us**  
has a section about the group itself and a section about the members:  
**Our Music**  
has some audio- and video-links of music that the group has performed.  
**Our Shows**  
has information on the upcoming shows the group has.  
**Contact**  
has a a contact form for booking or inquiries. Below there is a section with general contact information.
