            <h2 class="header-text">About Be-Sharp</h2>
            <p>The Dutch vocal group Be Sharp is group of 4 singers, 2 men and 2 women, that was founded in 2006.
                The singers were all taught by celebrated soprano and singing teacher Evelien van der Linden. 
                The group sings various repertoire in various styles: from classical to pop and from opera to musical
                and everything in between. During concerts the members of Be Sharp sing a combination of solos, duets,
                trios and quartets, which are based around a theme.</p>
            <p>
                The musical pieces are connected by use of acting and staging. This is done as mere transitions between
                pieces or as one continuous story. This is the strengths and uniqueness of Be Sharp. That doesn’t mean
                that Be Sharp doesn’t also perform
                only concertante style. Being the ones with the most acting experience of Be-Sharp, Linda and Rik usually write the shows main storylines.</p>
            <p>
                They have performed nationally as well as internationally with their various shows. To name a few:
                Mozart and more,
                Be Sharp has an annual Christmas show, which is held at the beautiful castle of Twickel in Delden.

                            <h4>Annette de Vries, soprano</h4>
                            <p>Annette found her love for singing at an early age, where she sang in a children’s choir.  A few years later she joined an all woman’s choir, where she got the opportunity to travel through Europe competing in the many international choir competitions. Here is where her love for performing developed.
Not very much later started singing lessons with the famous opera singer Evelien van der Linden. During her studies with Evelien she gained much progress and interpreted different roles in opera and operetta. Annette has been singing at Be-Sharp from the very beginning. She likes singing the more classical music.

                            <p> Although Linda has been singing since her childhood, acting was her first passion.  When she started out in the local musical and operetta company, she found a way to combine her two passions. Around the same time she started taking singing lessons from the well known singing teacher Evelien van der Linden. 
Linda enjoys combining the acting with the singing; to bring together singing and acting into a complete story. This is what she likes most about singing in Be-Sharp.

                            <p>Like many singers, Thomas sang since childhood. At first he mainly sang in the style of the more populair music, until he took singing lessons with renowned singing teacher Evelien van der Linden. She taught him the classical singing techniques and introduced him to the classical repertoire. With help of Evelien they found out that his voice suited the lyrical, dramatic tenor pieces. The best part of being in Be-Sharp is singing in the varied musical styles that occur in their shows.

                            <p>Rik started acting from a young age. He acted in many plays and productions during his teenage years. As far as singing goes, Rik is kind of a late bloomer. He has always liked singing, but that changed when he got his first part in a semi-professional production of The Showboat.  
Shortly after he took singing lessons with reputed singing teacher Evelien van der Linden.
She introduced him in the world of classical music. Rik likes singing classical music, especially from composers of the First Viennese School: Mozart, Haydn and Beethoven. But his heart lies in singing the more jazzy and evergreen songs. 
Due to his years of experience in acting, he aids Linda in creating the main story lines for their shows.
